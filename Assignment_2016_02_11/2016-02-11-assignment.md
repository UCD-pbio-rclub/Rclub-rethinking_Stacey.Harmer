# Statistical Rethinking Chapter 2, sections 2.1 - 2.3

Name: Stacey Harmer

## 2E1:   2) (Pr(rain±Monday)  (note that my pipes key is broken)

## 2E2:    the probability that it is Monday given that it is raining

## 2E3: 1)  Pr(Monday±rain) 

## 2E4: In a literal sense, the phrase 'the probability of water is 0.7' is meaningless. In the globe example in the text, my finger would or would not rest on water - my data points are binary (0 and 1), not fractions. 

## 2M3:  globes: earth and mars.  pw for earth = 07; pw for mars = 0. one toss of the globe = L observation.  what is the posterior probabilty that the globe tossed was the earth? that is, solve for Pr(earth±land) (answer is 0.23)

#Pr(p±w) = probability earth, given land.  so p = earth, w = land
#posterior = (0.3 * 0.5)/((1 + .3)/2) = 0.23

## 2M4:  6 possible sides of cards, 3 white and 3 black.  So the first ring of the garden has 6 paths, that lead to:  B  B  B  W W W.    Two of these black sides have black on the other face of the card (that is, they are the two sides of hte same card).  The third black card has white on the other side.  So the second ring of the garden is:  B  B  W  B W  W.    Thus 2 of the choices  leading from the first side = black yield second side = black.
