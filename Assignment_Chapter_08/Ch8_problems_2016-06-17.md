###8E1.  Required of simple Metropolis algorithm:  
3)  The proposal distribution must be symmetric.  

###8E2.  Gibbs sampling efficiency is greater than Metropolitan because it is more efficient at exploring the 
posterior disctribution; the parameter value at one moment helps adjust what the proopsed parameter values will
be.  (conjugate priors)

####8E3.  HMC can't handle discrete parameters.  this is because it 'glides' through possible parameter values 
and this isn't possible with discrete parameters.
